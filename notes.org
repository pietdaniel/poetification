Something something normalizing syllable weights.

-----------------

GENERAL:

Remove single element families.

Cast odd -> even based on weights.

Since we're only dealing with even sets, maybe it makes sense to take the largest and start with that.

Alternative-merge:
  Take largest
    Alternate with second largest
    When that's gone, return the poem. 
    Recur on the remainder.

If families don't rhyme (a b c d e ...), try haikus or dodoitsus.
Else, free form and sort by syllable.

Facebook: Tokenize by sentence.

TO-DO:::::
Form predicate functions.
General algorithm.
Alternative merging.
Free form cases.
Normalize weights.
